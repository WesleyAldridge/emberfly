Very early WIP of an idle game I am making inspired by Cookie Clicker.

Languages used (so far): JavaScript, CSS, HTML


## To-do:
- Convert similar HTML elements into React JS components
- Add more buildings
- Add upgrades
- Add graphics for buildings/upgrades

## Dynamic Lighting System:

- Lighting changes dynamically as you play, getting brighter as you accumulate fireflies and dimmer as you spend them.
